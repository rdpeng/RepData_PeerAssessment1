### Loading and processing data
```{r}

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE)
### convert character date to POSIX date
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d"),tz="")
#### first convert integer time to character and pad with leading zeros...
activity$time     <- sprintf("%04d", activity$interval)
#### fill in leading zeros
#### ...then convert to the date type

```
### What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}

activity$time     <- as.POSIXct(activity$time, "%H%M",tz="")
head(activity)
str(activity)
total_steps_by_date <- aggregate(list(total_steps = activity$steps),
                                 by=list(date = activity$date),
                                 FUN=sum,
                                 na.rm=TRUE)
                                 
mean(total_steps_by_date$total_steps)
median(total_steps_by_date$total_steps,na.rm=T)
```

###What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}

average_steps_by_time <- aggregate(list(average_steps = activity$steps),
                                   by=list(time = activity$time,
                                           interval = activity$interval),
                                   FUN=mean,
                                   na.rm=TRUE)

average_steps_by_time[which.max(average_steps_by_time$average_steps),]   
```
```{r}
###Plot -What is the average daily activity pattern?
plot(average_steps ~ time,
     data=average_steps_by_time,
     xlab="Time interval",
     ylab="Mean steps",
     main="Mean Steps By Time Interval",
     type="l",
     col="blue",
     lwd=2)

```

###Imputing missing values
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity[,"steps"]))
# "join" the two data frames using merge()
activity_imputed <- merge(activity,average_steps_by_time,by="interval")
#### correct the NA steps with average steps for the interval
activity_imputed <- within(activity_imputed,
                           steps <- ifelse(is.na(activity_imputed$steps),
                           activity_imputed$average_steps,
                           activity_imputed$steps))
                        
total_steps_by_date_imputed <- aggregate(list(total_steps = activity_imputed$steps),
                                         by=list(date = activity_imputed$date),
                                         FUN=sum,
                                         na.rm=FALSE)
```
###Plot - Total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(total_steps_by_date_imputed$total_steps,
     breaks=30,
     xlab="Total Steps",
     main="Total Steps Per Day",
     col="lightblue")
plot(density(total_steps_by_date_imputed$total_steps,
             na.rm=TRUE),
     xlab="Total Steps",
     ylab="Density",
     main="Total Steps Per Day",     
     col="purple",
     lwd=3)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
activity_imputed$weekday  <- weekdays(activity_imputed$date)

activity_imputed$weekend_indicator <- as.factor(apply(activity_imputed["weekday"], 1, function(x) {
  switch(x,
         "Sunday" = "weekend",
         "Saturday" = "weekend",
         "weekday")
}))

str(activity_imputed)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
```

```{r}

average_steps_by_time_weekend <- aggregate(list(average_steps = activity_imputed$steps),
                                           by=list(time       = activity_imputed$time.x,
                                                   daytype    = activity_imputed$weekend_indicator),
                                           FUN=mean)
```

###Now draw a panel plot using ggplot2, comparing activity patterns on weekdays and weekends.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = time,
      y = average_steps,
      geom="path",
      data = average_steps_by_time_weekend, 
      xlab="Time interval",
      ylab="Average steps",
      main="Activity Patterns\nWeekdays vs. Weekends",
      facets = daytype ~ .)

```
