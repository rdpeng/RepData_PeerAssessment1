What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

I will use to approaches

First is using aggregate function

StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
The Histogram is

hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5

And the mean and median is

mean(StepsTotal$steps)
## [1] 10766
median(StepsTotal$steps)
## [1] 10765
The second approach is to make a data frame first with the values that I need I create a data frame with the days and the total of steps by day

steps <- rep(NA, 61)
day <- rep("NA", 61)
stepsday <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = T)
length(stepsday)
## [1] 61
for (i in 1:61) {
    steps[i] <- stepsday[[i]]
    day[i] <- names(stepsday)[i]
}
then the data frame is

df <- data.frame(day, steps)
head(df)
##          day steps
## 1 2012-10-01     0
## 2 2012-10-02   126
## 3 2012-10-03 11352
## 4 2012-10-04 12116
## 5 2012-10-05 13294
## 6 2012-10-06 15420
Now i make the histogram

hist(df$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "green")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9

This second histogram is a bit differnt because the are some day that we have no data for the steps.

What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

Now I get mean of steps and time series plot

time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
The plot is:

plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5-min interval", 
    ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "Average number of steps taken", 
    col = "red")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

max_interval <- which.max(time_series)
names(max_interval)
## [1] "835"
Imputing missing values

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

activity_NA <- sum(is.na(activity))
activity_NA
## [1] 2304
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval,etc

Fist Na replaced by mean in 5 min interval

StepsAverage <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean)
fillNA <- numeric()
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
    obs <- activity[i, ]
    if (is.na(obs$steps)) {
        steps <- subset(StepsAverage, interval == obs$interval)$steps
    } else {
        steps <- obs$steps
    }
    fillNA <- c(fillNA, steps)
}
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

new_activity <- activity
new_activity$steps <- fillNA
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

StepsTotal2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
The Histogram is

hist(StepsTotal2$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-17

And the mean and median is

mean(StepsTotal2$steps)
## [1] 10766
median(StepsTotal2$steps)
## [1] 10766
After replacing the mean is the same but the median is a little bit different

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels  weekday and weekend indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

day <- weekdays(activity$date)
daylevel <- vector()
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
    if (day[i] == "Saturday") {
        daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
    } else if (day[i] == "Sunday") {
        daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
    } else {
        daylevel[i] <- "Weekday"
    }
}
activity$daylevel <- daylevel
activity$daylevel <- factor(activity$daylevel)

stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daylevel, data = activity, mean)
names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "daylevel", "steps")
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was creating using simulated data:

xyplot(steps ~ interval | daylevel, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-20
